"""
xpp ode to SBML file converter.

XPP file format is described here
http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/bardware/tut/newstyle.html

Every ODE file consists of a series of lines that start with a keyword followed by
numbers, names, and formulas or declare a named formula such as a differential equation or auxiliary quantity.
Only the first letter of the keyword is important; e.g. the parser treats "parameter" and "punxatawney" exactly the same.
The parser can understand lines up to 256 characters. You can use line continuation by adding a backslash character.
The first line of the file cannot be a number (as this tells XPP that the file is in the old-style) but can be any
other charcter or declaration. It is standard form to make the first line a comment which has the name of the
file, but this is optional.

Initial data are optional, XPP sets them to zero by default and they can be changed within the program.

Only supports subset of features.
